Challenges I Had
----------------
1) Figuring out how to get all the necessary information (all the info for the logs).  
To solve this I searched for any existing solutions to getting the necessary information  
that others had previously attempted to get. `strace` is a saviour since it does so much for you.
2) Having to deal with shells, subshells, and pipes to direct information to where it needs to be.  
I understood the basics from University, but had to refresh my memory on some things.
